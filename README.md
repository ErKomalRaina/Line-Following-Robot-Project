# Line-Following-Robot-Project
This is the Line Following Robot project which was done in the 6th semester of Engineering in which i Participated in the Monochrome National Level Competition at the Footprints Event by MSU University, Baroda and collaboratively built an autonomous line-following robot as part of a four-member team.
Here, I am attaching a short live video of my project during the testing phase. The project was later submitted for the event, where we successfully reached the finals and ranked among the Top 6 teams from across India.
